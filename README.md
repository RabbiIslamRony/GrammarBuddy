  - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions
  - The project includes an `.nvmrc` file for automatic version switching
  - To use the correct version:
    ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```
- npm (v10.2.4 or higher) or yarn (v1.22.19 or higher)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grammar-buddy.git
cd grammar-buddy
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the extension:

npm run build
```

### Development Commands
- `npm run build`: Build the extension
- `npm run watch`: Watch for changes and rebuild

### Creating a Release
To create a new release:

1. Make sure all changes are committed:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

2. Create a new tag (replace X.Y.Z with your version number):
```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
```

3. Push the tag to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

For example, to create and push version 1.0.0:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build the extension
- Create a new release
- Upload the built files
- Create a release artifact

You can verify the release by:
1. Going to your GitHub repository
2. Clicking on "Releases" in the right sidebar
